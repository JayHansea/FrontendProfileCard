            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
              I am a FullStack Software Engineer with a journey rooted in a deep
              fascination for technology's power to solve real-world problems.
              With extensive experience from creating responsive UIs with React
              and Next.js to building robust backends with Node.js and MongoDB.
              I thrive on transforming complex ideas into performant and
              scalable applications. My background is unique in that I am not
              just a builder, but also a passionate instructor, committed to
              empowering others through teaching and mentorship.

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>
              While my current experience has been incredibly valuable, I am
              driven to elevate my career to the next level. My primary goal in
              this program is to pass all given task while sharpening and
              deepening my skill that will make me a prime candidate for more
              senior engineering roles with greater responsibility and impact.
              This program is a catalyst for professional advancement, so I
              heard and I am ready to embrace the challenges ahead.

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>
              While I have worked with tools like Docker and have a foundational
              understanding of cloud services, my hands-on experience with
              automated, large-scale deployment strategies and CI/CD pipelines
              is an area I'm eager to strengthen. I want to gain the confidence
              to design, implement, and manage complex infrastructures from the
              ground up, ensuring seamless integration and continuous delivery
              in a fast-paced environment.

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
            <p>
              Remember the passion that drove you to transition into technology
              and the satisfaction you get from seeing your code come to life.
              Never lose the dual identity of being a builder and a teacher.
              Continue to embrace challenges, stay aligned with the rapid pace
              of technological advancement, and always make time to share your
              knowledge. Your biggest impact lies not just in the products you
              build, but in the people you inspire.

            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              I believe that technology's ultimate purpose is to enhance human
              connection and productivity. My work on collaboration platforms
              has reinforced this belief. As I grow, my focus remains on
              contributing to mission-driven projects that prioritize the user
              experience and leverage technology to create a more efficient and
              interconnected world. It's about writing code with empathy and
              purpose.
